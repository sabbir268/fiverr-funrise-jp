                            We at J.P Legal Funding LLC are helping law firms throughout the country with case costs and litigation expenses. We find that higher costs can make it difficult for law firms of all sizes (but especially smaller firms) to take on new clients. The reason
                            is sometimes you don’t have the resources you need to manage the costs and fees of those new cases, as well as the staffing challenges. That’s especially true for firms that like to work with clients on a contingency-fee-basis.
                            J.P Legal Funding LLC will help with funding, so please consider our Attorney’s Lawsuit Funding program, which is specifically structured to empower a Law Firm and allow you to perform to the highest level possible for your
                            clients.

                            your business claims. Commercial litigation funding unlocks the value of commercial lawsuits by providing an infusion of capital to business entities and law firms before and after your high-stake commercial claims reach a
