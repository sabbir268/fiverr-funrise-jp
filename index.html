                    <h2>FROM PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST</h2>
                    <p>J.P. Legal Funding LLC was founded because we saw a specific need for individuals and families
                        who
                        need financial help while they are waiting for their lawsuit to be resolved. We saw that
                        these
                        clients were burdened with increasing
                        medical bills and living expenses, but their cases weren’t settling fast enough to make
                        payments. We were formed to provide a way for plaintiffs to receive pre-settlement funding
                        and
                        give them peace of mind until their cases have
                        closed. We have helped thousands of individuals over the years with their financial needs
                        and
                        let them look forward to the sun rising every day.</p>

                                of all sizes (but especially smaller firms) to

                                manage the costs and fees of those new cases, as well as the staffing challenges.

                                especially true for firms that like to work

                                occur on private or public property and can be caused by uneven or cracked
                                sidewalks,
