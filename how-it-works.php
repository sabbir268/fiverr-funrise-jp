                        not reach a positive outcome, you will not have to repay us. We’ve made the application process simple because we know you are going through difficult times and you need some help. Several cases may qualify, including employment
                        cases, personal injury and many more.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Remember – we do all of the work: we will get in contact with the law firm and lawyers which are handling your current case. We will collect all the documents to produce a proper assessment regarding the potential and viability
                        value of your case. We make a choice to provide the advance to you, in some cases within 24 hours on approval. We transfer the funds to you when your advance is approved by us. We are here for you to make this as easy as possible
                        so you and your family can rest easy.</p>
