                <h2>FROM PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST</h2>
                <p>J.P. Legal Funding LLC was founded because we saw a specific need for individuals and families
                    who
                    need financial help while they are waiting for their lawsuit to be resolved. We saw that
                    these
                    clients were burdened with increasing
                    medical bills and living expenses, but their cases weren’t settling fast enough to make
                    payments. We were formed to provide a way for plaintiffs to receive pre-settlement funding
                    and
                    give them peace of mind until their cases have
                    closed. We have helped thousands of individuals over the years with their financial needs
                    and
                    let them look forward to the sun rising every day.</p>

                            The

                            you were driving a tractor or riding in a bus. If it involved a motor vehicle, we
                            can

                            get if they can afford to wait patiently. We can give you the time you need to let
                            your
                            lawyer fight longer to pursue the best possible

                            major damage, and may be held responsible for a plaintiff’s medical bills,

                        <p>Workers’ Compensation laws were created to protect injured workers by providing for
                            medical care, compensation for lost wages related to the injury, and rehabilitation
                            and/or retraining if necessary. Almost half of all workplace
                            injuries are serious enough to cause the employee to miss work or require ongoing
                            medical care.

                            Because paying these claims can be costly, employers don’t always believe they are
                            legitimate, creating undue delays in resolving them. Plaintiffs are responsible for
                            proving the employer was “at fault” in order to receive a settlement.</p>

                            the value of commercial lawsuits by providing an infusion of capital to business

                            Since these cases are not considered “no fault,” it is the claimant’s burden to

                            that the other party is liable.</p>
