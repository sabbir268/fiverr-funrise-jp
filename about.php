                    <p class="text-justify">J.P. Legal Funding LLC was founded because we saw a specific need for individuals and families who need financial help while they are waiting for their lawsuit to be resolved. We saw that these clients were burdened with increasing
                        medical bills and living expenses, but their cases werenâ€™t settling fast enough to make payments. We were formed to provide a way for plaintiffs to receive pre-settlement funding and give them peace of mind until their cases
                        have closed. We have helped thousands of individuals over the years with their financial needs and let them look forward to the sun rising every day.</p>
                    <p>We have adopted a customer-first philosophy that we live by every day:</p>

                    <p>Help people in difficult circumstances regain some control and take care of themselves and their families again.</p>
                    <p>Act responsibly and with total transparency so clients can make informed choices that are right for their specific circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Treat every client with a high level of respect, understanding and empathy.</p>
