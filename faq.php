                            <p>Pre-settlement funding is when a company gives you money right away in exchange for the right to receive a portion of your financial settlement in the future. You get money immediately to pay bills and pay nothing back
                                until you get money from the settlement of your claims. If you never get money from your claims, you never have to pay anything back to the legal funding company (the official term for this is “non-recourse”).</p>

                            <p>Pre-settlement funding is sometimes called consumer legal funding, this type of legal funding is not a funding; there is no debt, no monthly payments, and no risk of collections calls or wage garnishments. Any money paid
                                to the legal funding company comes only out of the proceeds of the settlement, never out of your pocket.</p>

                            <p>Funding that is non-recourse means it doesn’t have to be paid back if you lose your case. When you work with Sunrise, we offer to buy part of the proceeds you could receive from your settlement for money now, to help you
                                get by until the rest of your settlement comes in. It’s not a funding — it’s a purchase. Because it’s a purchase, qualifying for funding isn’t based on your credit score (like funding are), and it can never put you
                                into collections (like funding can). Because it’s a purchase, if you lose your case, you owe us nothing. Non-recourse pre-settlement funding can be a safe, stable alternative to taking out a funding while you wait and
                                can help you get back on your feet after an accident.</p>
